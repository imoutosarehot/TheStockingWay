# How to Learn Japanese (nihongo)

When it comes to learning languages, there is plenty of disinformation on the internet. From Refold (immersion propaganda/scam) to Duolingo, it often seems like everyone is out there to take your money. However, there are ways to fight back. By actually learning the language, and helping others do the same. Before we get into the best way to learn Japanese, lets talk about some common methods that don't work.

### Textbooks and Lessons

Textbooks and lessons etc. are designed purely to waste your time and distract you from learning. They were mostly written and set up by the pre-WWII Japanese government to keep gaijin from entering Japan. This was extremely effective, and Japan remains one of the purest countries in the world to this day, free of western influence. When the west finally falls, Japan will rise once again.

### AJATT

All Japanese All The Time is a popular scam that tells you to spend all day immersing (doing things in/using) in Japanese. This isn't an all bad approach, but the real harm here is where it leads you. Over 99.8% of AJATT learners do not lose their virginity, and what point is there to learning Japanese other than sex. Don't fall for this.

### Refold 

Refold is the grandchild of AJATT and is mostly just the same thing but watered-down and monetized, as to make it accessible for "リア充" (Japanaese idiom for "retard"). Following Refold may lead to good results in the short term, but you will soon hit a huge road block. Still better than AJATT, but I will teach you something far better.

### DJT

Do NOT join DJT under ANY circumstances. DJT is a CESSPOOL of RACISM and HOMOPHOBIA and whatever. ABSOULUTELY NEVER DO NOT LOOK IN THE "otaku artwork" channel. djt are hackers and they will doxx and contact your school. DJT do NOT welcome women (which means NO YURI) and you wiull NOT become fluent in anything other than stupid fucking メスガキ visual novels (not inherently bad but most arent yuri) and they WILL manipulate you into using "4chan" (english website, not immersion OR yuri)

### If all these learning methods are shit, how am I supposed to learn Japanese? I want to watch anime (JAV) without subtitles!

And that is where my method comes in. Yuri. I have an entire thesis written on why this works so well, but I will quickly explain the idea here. Start by learning every word in Japanese. Then start immersing in yuri and yuri only. Yuri is pure and perfect, and yuri will keep your Japanese clear from imperfections. The love and passion and sex between two women (or more) will keep you motivated for the years it takes to learn Japanese. Yuri is the most natural form of Japanese, ensuring you do not speak in an anime dialect (even if you only watched yuri anime).

### The Challenge of Traditional Learning

Learning Japanese through traditional materials often relies on intrinsic motivation. This intrinsic drive—whether it's a love for the language, the culture, or the art of Japanese kanji—is powerful, but it can be fragile. Without constant reinforcement, many learners find themselves adrift in a sea of kanji and grammar, clinging to dictionaries for support as their "boat of motivation" (船) slowly sinks. The result? Burnout, frustration, and abandonment of their language-learning journey. 不是不良...

The solution to this problem lies in harnessing a different kind of motivation—one rooted in the raw and instinctual forces that drive human behavior. For many, yuri erotica provides that spark.

### The Power of Yuri Erotica in Language Learning

Yuri erotica, with its vivid storytelling and compelling emotions, offers a unique and powerful motivational framework. By intertwining language acquisition with themes of intimacy, romance, and passion, yuri erotica taps into traits deeply embedded in our DNA. Whether it's scenes of yuri kissing, yuri scissoring, or even the tender exchanges of forbidden love, the emotional pull of this genre can transform language learning into an effortless endeavor.

You can learn millions of sex words. This is the kind of stuff Genki doesn't teach. If you wanna get Japanese bitches, you NEED to know how to talk dirty (えっち). Yuri often has very detailed sex scenes, were one girl fingers another and explains in detail the exact texture, feeling, sounds, etc. etc.. ! This is very useful for Japanese sex where you often need to use descriptive language.

Where textbooks and flashcards might fail to inspire, the allure of yuri erotica ensures consistent and enthusiastic engagement. Words and kanji no longer feel like abstract concepts; they become keys to unlocking the vibrant and often steamy worlds depicted in these stories.

### A Journey Through Yuri: From Vanilla to Complex

One of the most fascinating aspects of yuri erotica is its wide range of difficulty and diversity. Many learners start with simple, "vanilla" stories—those that focus on straightforward romance. These works provide a solid foundation for vocabulary and grammar, offering accessible language and relatable scenarios. As learners gain confidence, they often find themselves drawn to more complex or niche subgenres, such as BDSM or NTR (netorare).

This progression mirrors a natural language-learning process. By expanding into different themes, learners encounter domain-specific vocabulary in much the same way they would by studying fields like business or science. For example:

- **Vanilla Yuri**: Basic conversational phrases, romantic vocabulary, and common expressions.
- **BDSM Yuri**: Specialized terms related to roles, dynamics, and actions.
- **NTR Yuri**: Advanced storytelling, nuanced emotional language, and complex kanji.

This evolution keeps the learning process fresh and exciting. The genre’s inherent variety ensures that boredom is never an issue—a critical factor in maintaining long-term motivation.

### Yuri as a Path to Fluency

The immersive nature of yuri erotica makes it an unexpectedly powerful tool for language mastery. Consider this: in analyzing just 100 volumes of yuri literature, over 20,000 unique kanjis are covered extensively. Multiply this across the thousands of yuri novels available, and it becomes clear how this genre could enable learners to reach a high level of proficiency, potentially even passing advanced language exams like Kanken 1K.

Moreover, the difficulty spectrum of yuri means it caters to learners of all levels. Beginners can start with simpler works, while advanced learners can challenge themselves with dense, poetic prose or metaphor-rich storytelling.

### Expanding Beyond Novels: Yuri VN and ASMR

Yuri learning doesn’t stop with novels. Visual novels (VN) and ASMR provide additional layers of immersion. Visual novels bring the stories to life with voice acting, music, and visuals, allowing learners to see and hear the language in action. This multimedia approach reinforces vocabulary and grammar while introducing learners to natural pitch accents and conversational flow.

ASMR, on the other hand, offers an intimate and relaxing way to absorb language passively. By listening to yuri-themed ASMR content, learners can spend hours immersed in the sounds and rhythms of Japanese. This method is particularly effective for mastering pitch accent and intonation—a critical yet often overlooked aspect of fluency. Not only do you get to hear plently of dialogue, but detailed soundscapes will put you into the mind of a Japanese ASMR director. Remember, language goes beyond words.

### A Language-Learning Experience Like No Other

Yuri erotica offers a bold and deeply personal way to learn Japanese. By leveraging the emotional and motivational power of this genre, learners can transform their study sessions into moments of joy and passion. What starts as an unconventional experiment can quickly become a sustainable and highly effective path to fluency.

So why not trade your dusty textbooks for something a little more exciting? With yuri erotica, mastering Japanese could become one of the most rewarding journeys of your life.
