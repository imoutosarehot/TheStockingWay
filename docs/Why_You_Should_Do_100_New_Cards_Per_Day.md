This guide assumes that you know what anki is, how to use it, and more or less what the different settings are. This slightly branches away from the yuri themes of the rest of the website. Please be warned.

# TLDR

1. Pushing your limits is good and leads to progress.
2. Any and all recommendations for new cards are completely arbitrary. The only real value they have is being a reflection of other peoples experiences. These experiences may or may not be reflective of your own.
	2b. This goes for all recommended numbers, including recommended hours, ratios, etc. 
3. There have and will continue to be people who start off doing over 100 new cards per day. The only difference between these people and others is dedication and time investment.
4. Language acquisition comes from comprehensible input. How you make input comprehensible, especially at a low level, does not particularly matter so long as you understand the basic theory behind what you are doing. Knowing more words, even if they have not been acquired, makes input more comprehensible. 

Therefore:

You should do as many new cards as you are willing to do, or as many as you can. A common guideline is 10 to 20. Doing more may be effective and is worth trying. Doing less may be necessary for some people. The point is that it doesn't really matter. 

# 1 Pushing your limits is good

It is a commonly agreed upon idea, in basically all fields, that pushing your limits leads to progress. This includes language learning. If you observe people who have learned languages very quickly, you will find that most of the time they pushed their limits and put in a very high amount of time and effort. 

Even if you are not willing to leave your job and quit school for a language, you can still apply this. When you are reading, mixing in material on the very edge of your understanding will boost your progress. Although doing things that are difficult is more difficult than doing things that are easy, you generally get more out of doing things that are difficult. 

There are only two real arguments against this. One is that constant pursuit of difficulty can lead to burnout. This is true. That is why it is necessary to understand your own limits and pace yourself. The best way to understand your limits is by going beyond them. 

The other argument I forgot about.

	Side note: Reading only difficult books and neglecting to get a large volume of input from easier material when you are tired is worse than never pushing yourself. Volume, in the end, is the most important metric.

# 2 Language learning is not math 

There is no objective optimal number of vocabulary cards to learn per day. Any number that is recommended to you is arbitrary and mostly just an excuse to not explain things further. A commonly recommended number of new cards for beginners is 10 to 20 per day. This is completely reasonable but should not be treated as a rule, as it so often is. Treating this as a rule only harms learners who are able and willing to do more cards per day. 

Generally, if you do more new cards per day, you will have more reviews per day. If you have too many reviews, you can reduce them by doing less new cards. This means that if you do too many new cards and you can't handle it, you can always do less. The worst that happens is you need to skip new cards for a few days as your reviews die down. 

The same applies for the recommended hours of anki, immersion, etc. that you do per day. These are more or less arbitrary. The only real metric is that more volume is better. Getting immersion alongside anki is vital to actually acquiring a language. Doing a 2:1 ratio of immersion to anki is complete bullshit. All that matters is that you do both for a non-insignificant amount of time every day. Mind you, you don't even need to do either of these every day so long as you do them 99% of the time. But that is a different argument. 

Doing less than a combined 1 hour per day will probably not result in progress, but is fine if you are limited. It is always fine to do what you can. A lot of people learning languages, especially Japanese, do not have jobs. Or friends, school, or other hobbies. These people will progress faster because they are able to achieve a higher volume of immersion, anki, etc. If you have a job, you will progress slower. That is fine. The only guideline is to do as much as you are able and willing to do. More is better. 

The main point that I am trying to get at is that it doesn't matter. What you do doesn't matter. Almost every "method" is just its own set of rules to restrict you. 

# 3 This is not theoretical stoner bullshit

There always have and will continue to be people who start off a premade anki deck doing over 100 new cards per day. These people either burn out very fast or progress very fast. You are under no obligation to copy them, but the existence of people going above and beyond with their dedication to learning a language should be an example. It should also be proof that there is no reason to limit yourself to 10 or 20 cards per day. Try it. If you get burned out on your first day, that is fine. Now you know what you are and aren't capable of.

While I say this, there are also very advanced learners who have never used anki before (though they usually agree that anki would have sped up their learning). This is because anki is an unnecessary part of the learning process. It is a tool to aid your progress. How you use anki does not really matter so long as you immerse. That said, for beginners using anki is the difference between hammering in a nail with your hand or an actual hammer. Doing 10 new cards per day is like hitting the nail with the hammer, but only gently. You will eventually get the nail in, and if you are busy doing 10 other tasks at the same time, it may be the only way to get it in. But this doesn't mean its bad to hit the nail harder and do 20 new cards per day. Or 30. Or 40. Or 50. You should hit the nail as hard as you can. 

# 4 Language learning is comprehensible input 

This is the generic phrase that forms the basis of all methods recommending immersion in a language as a way to learn it. This idea has been proven to be true over and over again. As a beginner in a language, you will not be able to comprehend most input. There are many ways to solve this, such as finding heavily simplified input. You could also use subtitles and a dictionary. You could also memorize a lot of words in order to recognize them, which increases comprehension, which in turn helps you actually acquire said words. Imagine if there was a way to memorize a lot of words in a very short span of time. 

This is where the actual benefit of doing a fuckton of anki comes in. It will directly speed up your improvement in the language. It is not the only way of speeding up your improvement, but it is a valid and effective way of doing so. It may not be the best method for every single learner, but the really great thing about anki is that you can always delete it. 

# What all of this means 

As I have implied several times so far, I am suggesting that language learners could potentially benefit from doing anki. While the current standard of a tiny bit of anki and a fuckton of immersion is fine, it has also turned into a dogma that harms learners. Learners of a language should be encouraged to try various options to see what works for them, including anki at more than 10 new cards per day. Learners who want to try doing significantly above average amounts of anki per day should be encouraged to try it and see if it works, instead of shunned for exceeding the arbitrary and misleading recommendations. 

Here are my recommendations:

Start at 10 or 20 cards per day. If you feel like that isn't enough, do more. If you want to. If that feels like too much, then do less. If you are jobless and want to do 6 hours of anki per day, you should. If you were doing 50 per day but its starting to become too much, then do less. 

You could also consider doing a different amount per day based on how you are feeling. This is a method I often use, since I struggle with mental illness. Don't skip reviews though, unless you need to.

For advanced learners, I suggest learning every card you mine on the same day you mine it. You can do this by setting your new cards to 9999 (assuming you have no backlog) and then keeping it like that forever. This is part of how I like to approach reading, which will be a different article.

I want learners to be free to try various different options. I want people to stop getting pissed over people doing things in a different way than themselves. My experience with anki has been mixed at best, mainly because it took me a long time to find a way of doing it that worked for me.
