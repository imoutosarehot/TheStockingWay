# The Yuri Way

If you are looking to learn Japanese, you have come to the right place.

If you are brand new to language learning, read the [30 Day Guide](30_Day_Guide.md), [FAQ](FAQ.md), and [Learn Japanese With Yuri](Learn_Japanese_With_Yuri.md). Then read the rest of the website. 

If you are not a beginner, consider reading the many guides and articles I have written:

- [The Yuri Method](The_Yuri_Method.md)
- [Resources](Resources.md)
- [Finding Yuri](Finding_Yuri.md)

If you have any questions or wish to meet likeminded fans of yuri, join the discord server:
