## FAQ 

### What should I immerse in?

Immerse in yuri. Starting with yuri anime, subbed or unsubbed, should be good. You can also read yuri doujin and manga to practice reading, and once you have a decent vocabulary (at least a few hundred words in kaishi) you can start reading. Please refer to my Yuri Roadmap. At this early stage it helps to put a heavy focus on sexual yuri, because it will motivate you to read more.

### Where should I ask questions?

You can join the discord linked on the main page, but I suggest using google. Most questions asked by beginners are retarded. Please accent that if you are a beginner, nobody likes you and everything you say is stupid and uninformed. Every question you have has been asked before. Accept that you are wrong, and embrace yuri.
