Learning Japanese can be a very tedious and long journey, and I think it may be helpful to share my approach to different parts.

### Deciding what to immerse with.

Starting as an extention of the Shoui method, I like to rotate my focus back and forth between reading and listening over several day periods. There is no particular length as I am a very distractible person, but the point is that you go all in on listening or reading on a particular day. 

Focusing on one thing at a time makes it easier, in my experience, to get a lot of volume consistently, and to avoid demotivation. For listening days, I will watch at least one season of anime, maybe more, maybe split across several series. For reading days, I set a goal of one volume or equivalent. You can do whatever you want outside of those set goals for the day, as long as you complete them.

I find that listening is a lot easier when I am tired and tend to watch more of it during the week, when I have school etc. Reading I mostly do on the weekend because it feels more productive, but I also read at least a bit every day during my free time when I am not at home. I also listen a bit every night before bed, with asmr. 

### Watching anime, drama, etc.

While using subtitles is useful at times, I think it is important to avoid using them if you can get away with it. I have a plugin that automatically downloads subs for me, but I only show them (asb player can hide loaded subs with the down arrow key) when my listening isnt enough to keep up, or if I catch a word I don't know. For series without subtitles, I either do my best or plan to watch them in the future when I have higher comprehension.

For lots of shitty sloppa anime that don't really have any artistic value, I do tend to increase the speed to 1.5x or 2x speed. I personally find it easiest to watch anime on my phone, in bed, because its not a very active process, but I just as often use my computer.
### Reading

Reading is reading there isn't really much to say. Easier content like most VN and LN are great for reading a ton of, since you can get very high comprehension and reading speed fairly easy. I think that reading real books is important though, especially for learning vocabulary and pushing yourself.

I sometimes use subvocalization and sometimes don't, it really depends on the difficulty of the test. Not subvocalizing is obviously faster, just do what feels right. Obsessing over reading speed is stupid. Don't measure reading speed. Don't even think about speed or compare your speed to other peoples. Reading speed is pure brainrot. Don't whitenoise books just to have faster reading speed or meet some sort of arbitrary quota. 

Reading multiple books at one is normal for me. I tend to read one harder book for maybe an hour or two, and then spend a lot more time with LN sloppa because it is mindless. VN are also great. When you are unmotivated, reading yuri with a more sexual focus can serve as temporary motivation to keep going, but don't fall into the trap of ONLY reading erotic yuri. There is plenty of non erotic yuri, and some of the most beautiful and moving stories are in that category.

### Mining

I mine every word that has:
- A new kanki 
- A new reading or a weird reading
- Words that I feel like mining 
- Yoji and kotowaza where the meaning isn't obvious

I mine words from wherever I feel like mining from. Especially in TMW there is some sort of idea that mining anything you don't find naturally is some sort of sin, which is genuinely retarded. Mine things you want to mine. If you see a word written in kana but it has kanji in yomitan, mine it with kanji. If you find a cool family of words/characters (e.g. 大字 numbers like 壱.. I mined the wikipedia page for them cause they looked cool), and you want to memorize them, mine them.

I also mined all kanji not in my kanji grid from the quizzmaster kanken deck (trying to stick to words used in the example sentences, but also other words if there were no good options) because I wanted to, and I already had most kanken kanji mined anyways. Words are words. 

### Anki

I like to do my reviews on my phone in the morning, either in bed or during my commute to school. I find that I get the highest comprehension in either the morning or very late at night. I don't measure my speed and I set the timer to end at 1s so that I can't look at it. Take as long as you need to do anki. Going faster is generally better but go at whatever pace is natural.

For new cards, I have no set limit and learn as many as I have in my backlog. I don't do new cards every day, I tend to let them build up and then do 100~200 a day for a few days. I always do them at my computer so I can attach images to any cards that need them. Images are extremely helpful for various objects.

I mark cards based off of reading and meaning. For meaning I try to remember points highlighted in the definition (if there are any) to differentiate them from synonyms, but I don't think too much about it. When I recall the reading I tend to recall pitch accent alongside it (subvocalizing the word includes pitch), but if I get that wrong I just note it and move on.

I use 1m 10m intervals for new cards and 10m for lapsed cards. I have leeches set to whatever the default is, and to automatically be suspended. I either delete leeches, reset them, or unsuspend manually every once in a while.

Suspending and deleting cards that are low quality or have a word that you don't want is fine. I delete a lot of my older cards that I mined for stupid reasons when I was newer.

### ASMR

This is one of the key points of the yuri method. Every night before bed I listen to erotic yuri asmr, for around 30 minutes to an hour or more. This is a perfect way to end the day, in every way. ASMR is audio only and helps you get away from screens before bed. The start of the ASMR is usually lore, so you can brush your teeth etc while listening to that part. 

Masturbation is also exhausting, and if you do it in bed every day before sleeping you will even begin to associate it with falling asleep. I started doing this long before I started Japanese, and if I do it during the day when I am kind of tired but not ready to fall asleep, I almost always fall asleep after regardless.

ASMR is a very intimate form of media that demands your full attention. You listen to it with no distractions and no outside thoughts, following along with the actions of the characters and inserting yourself into the story. The pleasure ASMR leaves you with forms a mental connection between Japanese and pleasure. The long and extended nature of ASMR can induce pleasure far stronger than mere imagination or stardard pornography.

This extended exposure to Japanese before sleeping also makes sure you are thinking about Japanese from the start of your day (anki) to the moment you fall asleep.

### Audiobooks

I haven't really listened to any audiobooks yet. This section will be added in the future, alongside podcasts etc. if I find good ones.

### Music

While music isn't really immersion or yuri, the Japanese music scene goes very deep and has some very unique sounds. You can mine from music if you want to, and I have done just that many times in the past. Lyrics also stick themselves in your head very easily.

### Output 

My output isn't very good, so I can't say anything conclusive. What I can say is that if you need to think to output, it probably isn't very good. Talking to Japanese people is fun though, and I recommend it because it feels good to use Japanese and you can learn from it. I will write more about this once I get better at output.
