Amist a sea of straight "romance" it can be hard to find yuri. Finding yuri of the correct level is even harder. This will serve as a hub of sorts, for immersion material at every stage of your Japanese learning experience. 

I will only be listing stuff that I have read in Japanese on this list, which isn't much. It will be continuously updated as I read more, especially the latter sections.

If you don't want to wait for manual updates, ご覧くださいませ:

Also, do remember my top tier yuri technique, which is to convince yourself that male characters (usually self insert and without any personality anyways) are women. This works best for novels where you can't see the characters. Dansei-muke asmr are also just a single female VA most of the time. Anything can be yuri.
