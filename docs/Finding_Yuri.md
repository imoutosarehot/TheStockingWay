# Finding Yuri

Sometimes, amidst a vast sea of "straight" "romance" it can be hard to find true love depicted in our media. But never give up, there is yuri everywhere.

Remember that yuri takes many names. Girls love, lesbianism, etc. Sometimes something may be yuri without looking like yuri. Sometimes there is yuri bait. Sometimes websites will but futanari yuri in a whole seperate category, blocking you from thousands upon thousands of stories. 

There is always more yuri.

If you are truly out of yuri, you still have your imagination. Most anime men are submissive and plain; hollow shells made purely for self insertion. Pretend that they are women, and you can immerse in yuri. Sometimes there is yuri bait, but you can imagine them having sex between volumes. 

Yuri is fairly new in popular media. The further you go back, the less yuri sex there is. But the works that laid the very foundation for yuri are not to be ignored.

For recommendations, it is hard to recommend anything I have not read myself.
