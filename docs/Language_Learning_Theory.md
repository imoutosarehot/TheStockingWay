# How to Learn Japanese (nihongo)

When it comes to learning languages, there is plenty of disinformation on the internet. From Refold (immersion propaganda/scam) to Duolingo, it often seems like everyone is out there to take your money. However, there are ways to fight back. By actually learning the language, and helping others do the same. Before we get into the best way to learn Japanese, lets talk about some common methods that don't work.

### Textbooks and Lessons

Textbooks and lessons etc. are designed purely to waste your time and distract you from learning. They were mostly written and set up by the pre-WWII Japanese government to keep gaijin from entering Japan. This was extremely effective, and Japan remains one of the purest countries in the world to this day, free of western influence. When the west finally falls, Japan will rise once again.

### AJATT

All Japanese All The Time is a popular scam that tells you to spend all day immersing (doing things in/using) in Japanese. This isn't an all bad approach, but the real harm here is where it leads you. Over 99.8% of AJATT learners do not lose their virginity, and what point is there to learning Japanese other than sex. Don't fall for this.

### Refold 

Refold is the grandchild of AJATT and is mostly just the same thing but watered-down and monetized, as to make it accessible for "リア充" (Japanaese idiom for "retard"). Following Refold may lead to good results in the short term, but you will soon hit a huge road block. Still better than AJATT, but I will teach you something far better.

### DJT

Do NOT join DJT under ANY circumstances. DJT is a CESSPOOL of RACISM and HOMOPHOBIA and whatever. ABSOULUTELY NEVER DO NOT LOOK IN THE "otaku artwork" channel. 

### If all these learning methods are shit, how am I supposed to learn Japanese? I want to watch anime (JAV) without subtitles!

And that is where my method comes in. Yuri. I have an entire thesis written on why this works so well, but I will quickly explain the idea here. Start by learning every word in Japanese. Then start immersing in yuri and yuri only. Yuri is pure and perfect, and yuri will keep your Japanese clear from imperfections. The love and passion and sex between two women (or more) will keep you motivated for the years it takes to learn Japanese. Yuri is the most natural form of Japanese, ensuring you do not speak in an anime dialect (even if you only watched yuri anime).

ぺろぺろ. (japanese idiom for "joy")

# Beginner Stages

When you are a beginner you don't understand shit. You want to consume easier yuri. Most yuri is easy. Anime with subtitles are probably the way to go, but novels like 週に一度クラスメイトを買う話 are also very easy. You also want to complete kaishi and learn about grammar. Don't obsess over small details and PLEASE don't fall for weird bullshit guides. Yuri is the way.

Listening at the start is useful even if you don't understand much because it helps develop your ear. Also consider using Kotu to develop very basic pitch and stuff.

# Intermediate Stages 

Once you can read things you should read a lot and immerse a lot, mostly in yuri. It is at this stage that yuri hentai and eroge and stuff really becomes quite accessible. You can also start mining.

When you are mining, I suggest mining everything that contains a new kanji or a new reading for a kanji. You can also mine things that have weird meanings. Don't mine hiragana. Don't mine compound words, always mine the most "basic" version of a word. E.g. if you wanted to mine 百合恋愛, mine 百合 and 恋愛 not 百合恋愛.

If a card is to hard, suspend it. Relearn it or delete it, it doesn't matter. If a word is important, you will eventually learn it through immersion or end up mining it again anyways. Anki is a mere tool to support your learning.

As soon as you can, you should also stop watching anime and shit with japanese subs, because subs are cope. If you still struggle with comprehension, you can load subs with asbplayer and press the down key on your keyboard to hide them. Then only look at the subs when you don't catch something.

Reading things of the right difficulty is important, but reading things that you want to read is even more important. I often read multiple things at once, of various levels of difficulty. You could consider reading 10k of something hard and then 50k of something easier (e.g. yuri erotica) every day to still learn new words but not tire yourself out super fast. 

Don't obsess over reading spead but also don't be lazy as fuck. The faster you can read yuri and with more comprehension, the faster you get to the sex parts. The sex parts are the good parts. The sex creates a feedback loop, and you become addicted to yuri erotica.

Every night before bed, you should also be listening to erotic yuri asmr. This should happen in the dark, under the blankets, with a butt plug in. You want to hear the yuri, immerse in the yuri, and feel the pleasure of the yuri. This will make Japanese truly addicting. Endless yuri.

Once you have high enough comprehension, you can also read faster buy not subvocalizing while you read. Understand that if you do this, you risk whitenoising. Have self control and self awareness and this shouldn't be an issue.
